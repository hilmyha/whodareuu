    <p class="">
      Hi, my name Hilmy Ahmad Haidar, you can call me Haidar. I love turning ideas into functional apps, working
      across both front-end and back-end to create intuitive and engaging
      experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      I specialize in smooth user interfaces with React/React Native and
      scalable back-end systems using Laravel, and NestJS, including building
      Microservices, RESTful APIs and integrating third-party services.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Collaboration and continuous learning drive me. I enjoy working in teams
      with Git and tackling challenges that push my skills. Let’s connect and
      build something amazing together!
